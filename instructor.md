# Instructions for Instructing

- Intro:
  - What is a finite state machine?
  - What is a state chart?
  - What is XState?
  - Why this approach?
- Demo Code Sandbox:
  - Click the link
  - Move XState inspector to new window
  - Walk through README
  - Complete first two steps of Exercise A
- Split up instructions:
  - Teams of <= 5 people each
  - Choose a presenter & switch presenters for each challenge
  - Return when done or 10-15 minutes before session end
  - If done very early, switch presenters and create a workflow for a custom application
- Start breakout sessions

During the sessions:

- Round-robin drop-ins for each team, about 5 minutes each
- If things are going well: Ask them to explain _how it works_
- If things are going poorly: Ask leading questions, but try not to give answers
- Record any feedback

As teams return, **write down each team's feedback**. Here are some questions to ask:

- What was easy about the challenges? What was hard?
- Could you see your team defining application workflows this way? Why or why not?
- What related training would you like to see next? What areas do you want to learn more about?
- Would you be interested in early adoption, or would you rather wait to see a fully matured solution? Why?
